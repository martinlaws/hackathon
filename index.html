        <p>
          #HackWithIX Will be located at the Bahen Centre for Information Technology, at the
          University of Toronto. 40 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4. The Bahen Centre is accessible
          by TTC on the College Streetcar Line (Beverley St. Stop).
        </p>
        <h5>What if I've never been to a hackathon before?</h5>
        <p>
          #HackWithIX is meant to be a learning experience; whether it’s your first time or you’re a
          hackathon vet. Don’t worry, our event staff will make sure you know what to do.
        </p>
        <h5>Can I start working on my hack before the event?</h5>
        <p>
          We’ve announced the theme but the specifics of the challenge are yet to be revealed.
          We can’t stop you from doing research but it’s unlikely anything you work on in advance
          will be useful and it would be frowned upon by judges.
        </p>
        <h5>How does judging work?</h5>
        <p>
          A panel of industry experts will be chosen to review each team's
          submission and judged on a predefined set of criteria.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article id="teams-tab" class="tab-content">

        <p>
          The event is open to post-secondary students and students in bootcamp style
          intensives from all disciplines! A development or design background is an asset.
        </p>
        <h5>How many people can be on one team, and what if I don't have a team?</h5>
        <p>
          Team size is capped at four people per team.
          Don't have a team? No problem! We will assign solo participants to appropriate teams.
        </p>
        <h5>What makes a good team?</h5>
        <p>
          If you’re registering as a team we recommend having people that specialize
          in the following three areas for a well rounded team: front-end development,
          back-end development, and ux/ui design.
